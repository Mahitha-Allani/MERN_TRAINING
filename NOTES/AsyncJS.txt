****Asynchronous JS****

Js is a single threaded programming language.[Multi-Threading is not available in JS]

A thread can do multiple tasks at a time.

Blocking and Non-Blocking:
Blocking: A thread is waiting for some event to happen.
    a) Blocking Synchrounous
    b) Blocking Asynchronous 
Non-Blocking: A thread is not waiting for some event to happen.(ex:console.log()--synchronous)

Synchrounous: A step by step execution of a program.
all loops in js execute synchronously.

****ASYNC OPERATIONS IN Node.js*****

file system operations
HTTP requests
Database operations
Timers
Cryptographic operations
Email sending
Compression and decompression
Stream operations

=>
Browser JS runtime = javascript engine + web APIs + Event loop
Node JS runtime = javascript engine + Node APIs + Event loop

***Asynchronous JS:***

Asynchronous JS is a non-blocking JS.
It does not block the main thread.
It allows us to execute multiple tasks at a time.

Synchronous blocking : it is blocking the main thread and the event loop.
synchronous non-blocking: it is not blocking the main thread.

Asynchronous non-blocking: it does not block the main thread.
Asynchronous blocking   : it blocks the main thread but does not block the event loop.

***TIMER FUNCTIONS***

setTimeout(() => {},timeout)
setInterval(() => {},timeout)

Timer fucntions executes Asynchronously.

***PROMISES***
Promise is a object which is used to handle the asynchronous operations.
It has three process states:
1. Pending
2. Fulfilled
3. Rejected
Every process represents a future action.
ex:a promise to call in 10 min.
